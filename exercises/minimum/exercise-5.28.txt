Exercise 5.28
=============

Modify the definition of the evaluator by changing eval-sequence as
described in section [5.4.2] so that the evaluator is no longer
tail-recursive.  Rerun your experiments from exercises [5.26] and [5.27]
to demonstrate that both versions of the factorial procedure now require
space that grows linearly with their input.
