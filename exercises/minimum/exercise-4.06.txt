Exercise 4.6
============

Let expressions are derived expressions, because

(let ((<var₁> <exp₁>) ... (<var_(n)> <exp_(n)>))
  <body>)

is equivalent to

((lambda (<var₁> ... <var_(n)>)
   <body>)
 <exp₁>
 ...
 <exp_(n)>)

Implement a syntactic transformation let->combination that reduces
evaluating let expressions to evaluating combinations of the type shown
above, and add the appropriate clause to eval to handle let expressions.
