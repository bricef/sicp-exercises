Exercise 3.60
=============

With power series represented as streams of coefficients as in exercise
[3.59], adding series is implemented by add-streams.  Complete the
definition of the following procedure for multiplying series:

(define (mul-series s1 s2)
  (cons-stream <??> (add-streams <??> <??>)))

You can test your procedure by verifying that sin² x + cos² x = 1, using
the series from exercise [3.59].
