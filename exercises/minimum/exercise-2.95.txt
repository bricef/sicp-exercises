Exercise 2.95
=============

Define P₁, P₂, and P₃ to be the polynomials

P₁ : x² - 2x + 1

P₂ : 11x² + 7

P₃ : 13x + 5

Now define Q₁ to be the product of P₁ and P₂ and Q₂ to be the product of
P₁ and P₃, and use greatest-common-divisor (exercise [2.94]) to compute
the GCD of Q₁ and Q₂. Note that the answer is not the same as P₁. This
example introduces noninteger operations into the computation, causing
difficulties with the GCD algorithm.⁽⁶¹⁾ To understand what is
happening, try tracing gcd-terms while computing the GCD or try
performing the division by hand.
